I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <span style="color: #6f42c1;">"New Quantum Resources and Thermodynamics Group"</span> at the [International Centre for Theory of Quantum Technologies (ICTQT)](https://ictqt.ug.edu.pl), [University of Gdańsk](https://en.ug.edu.pl), where I work under the supervision of <span style="color: #6f42c1;">Prof. Dr. Michał Horodecki</span>. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in quantum thermodynamics from the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/english/institutional/), Brazil, under the supervision of <span style="color: #6f42c1;">Prof. Dr. Frederico Brito</span>. You can find my thesis [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07439).

I am particularly passionate about:

     ● Quantum Thermodynamics
     ● Open Quantum Systems
     ● Quantum Information
     ● Stochastic Thermodynamics

My research explores the interplay between quantum information, thermodynamics, and open systems, aiming to uncover new fundamental limits and applications for emerging quantum technologies 2.0.

For details on my work, see my [publications page](/publications/). I’m always open to discussions and collaborations—feel free to reach out!

Before moving to quantum sciences, I have worked with MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) and neuroengineering. You can find my Msc Dissertation [here](https://repositorio.unicamp.br/Acervo/Detalhe/965393) (in portuguese).
