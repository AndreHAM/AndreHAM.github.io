            <p>Modern breakthroughs in <span style="color: #6f42c1;">quantum information theory</span> and <span style="color: #6f42c1;">thermodynamics</span>, combined with advances in nanoscale fabrication and quantum control, are driving the next wave of <span style="color: #6f42c1;">Quantum Technologies 2.0</span>. These next-generation devices exploit quantum phenomena to revolutionize computing, communication, sensing, and simulation—raising crucial question: Do quantum effects play any role in thermodynamics? If so, can we use it?
        This challenge has given rise to <span style="color: #6f42c1;">quantum thermodynamics</span>, providing the tools to explore how quantum principles can enhance energy control in quantum counterparts of thermal devices.

At the nanoscale, managing heat flows—<span style="color: #6f42c1;">thermotronics</span>—mirrors electronics, enabling thermal logic and energy-efficient computing. Understanding these quantum-thermodynamic processes is key to optimizing energy use and minimizing waste heat.
My research sits at the intersection of

    ● Quantum Thermodynamics
    ● Open Quantum Systems
    ● Quantum Information
    ● Quantum Thermotronics
    
to develop strategies to control energy flow in quantum systems and novel devices.

<div class="text-justify">
  <p>A quantum thermal device (QTD) is a system designed to perform specific thermodynamic tasks using quantum systems interacting with thermal reservoirs. Its operation depends on several key factors: the number of subsystems and reservoirs, their physical properties (such as dimensionality, energy spectrum, and particle statistics), temperature gradients, spatial arrangement, system-reservoir couplings, and internal interactions between subsystems.</p>

            <p>My research systematically explores QTD parameters to develop novel architectures, with particular focus on <span style="color: #6f42c1;">quantum thermal transistors (QTTs)</span> and <span style="color: #6f42c1;">quantum batteries (QBs)</span>. A key objective involves optimizing their operational performance, including developing strategies to mitigate intrinsic QB discharge processes caused by environmental effects (TWM protocol) and enhancing heat flow amplification in QTTs. I am particularly interested in advancing the practical implementation of such devices beyond proof-of-principle demonstrations, especially within circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #6f42c1;">Foundations of quantum thermodynamics</span></h2>

<div class="text-justify">
I am deeply interested in the fundamental aspects of quantum thermodynamics, particularly in establishing general quantum counterparts of classical thermodynamic quantities such as work, heat, and entropy. Current definitions are typically limited to specific scenarios constrained by weak-coupling and Markovian assumptions—while thermodynamically relevant, these restrictions limit their applicability to more general cases.
</div>

<div class="text-justify">
To address this, we propose a universal definition of internal energy applicable to arbitrary quantum systems, including strongly coupled and fully autonomous scenarios. Remarkably, by starting from an isolated system, this approach enables the identification of time-dependent local operators (interpreted as <span style="color: #6f42c1;">local effective Hamiltonians</span>) whose expectation values sum to the total internal energy. This formulation naturally satisfies <span style="color: #6f42c1;">energy additivity</span> while maintaining broad applicability.
