<div class="text-justify">
  <p>A quantum thermal device (QTD) is a system designed to perform specific thermodynamic tasks using quantum systems interacting with thermal reservoirs. Its operation depends on several key factors: the number of subsystems and reservoirs, their physical properties (such as dimensionality, energy spectrum, and particle statistics), temperature gradients, spatial arrangement, system-reservoir couplings, and internal interactions between subsystems.</p>

        <p>My research systematically explores QTD parameters to develop novel architectures, with particular focus on <span style="color: #6f42c1;">quantum thermal transistors (QTTs)</span> and <span style="color: #6f42c1;">quantum batteries (QBs)</span>. A key objective involves optimizing their operational performance, including developing strategies to mitigate intrinsic QB discharge processes caused by environmental effects and enhancing heat flow amplification in QTTs. I am particularly interested in advancing the practical implementation of such devices beyond proof-of-principle demonstrations, especially within circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms.</p>
