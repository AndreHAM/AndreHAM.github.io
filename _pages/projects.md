        <p>Modern breakthroughs in quantum information theory and thermodynamics, combined with advances in nanoscale fabrication and quantum control, are driving the next wave of quantum technologies 2.0. These next-generation devices exploit quantum phenomena to revolutionize computing, communication, sensing, and simulation—raising crucial question: Do quantum effects play any role in thermodynamics? If so, can we use it?
        This challenge has given rise to quantum thermodynamics, where we explore how quantum principles can enhance energy control in quantum counterparts of thermal devices. At the nanoscale, managing heat flows—thermotronics—mirrors electronics, enabling thermal logic and energy-efficient computing. Understanding these quantum-thermodynamic processes is key to optimizing energy use and minimizing waste heat.
            My research sits at this intersection, developing strategies to control energy in quantum thermodynamic systems.

<div class="text-justify">
  <p>A quantum thermal device (QTD) is a system designed to perform specific thermodynamic tasks using quantum systems interacting with thermal reservoirs. Its operation depends on several key factors: the number of subsystems and reservoirs, their physical properties (such as dimensionality, energy spectrum, and particle statistics), temperature gradients, spatial arrangement, system-reservoir couplings, and internal interactions between subsystems.</p>

A key objective involves optimizing their operational performance, including developing strategies to mitigate intrinsic QB discharge processes caused by environmental effects (TWM protocol) and enhancing heat flow amplification in QTTs. I am particularly interested in advancing the practical implementation of such devices beyond proof-of-principle demonstrations, especially within circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms.</p>
