  abstract={Navigating the intricacies of thermal management at the quantum scale is a challenge in the pursuit of advanced nanoscale technologies. To this extent, theoretical frameworks introducing minimal models mirroring the functionality of electronic current amplifiers and transistors, for instance, have been proposed. Different architectures of the subsystems composing a quantum thermal device can be considered, tacitly bringing drawbacks or advantages if properly engineered. This paper extends the prior research on thermotronics, studying a strongly coupled three-subsystem thermal device with a specific emphasis on a third excited level in the control subsystem. Our setup can be employed as a multipurpose device conditioned on the specific choice of internal parameters: heat switch, rectifier, stabilizer, and amplifier. The exploration of the detuned levels unveils a key role in the performance and working regime of the device. We observe a stable and strong amplification effect persisting over broad ranges of temperature. We conclude that considering a three-level system, as the one directly in contact with the control temperature, boosts output currents and the ability to operate our devices as a switch at various temperatures.},

abstract={The superposition of causal orders shows promise in various quantum technologies. However, the fragility of quantum systems arising from environmental interactions, leading to dissipative behavior and irreversibility, demands a deeper understanding of the possible instabilities in the coherent control of causal orders. In this work, we employ a collisional model to investigate the impact of an open control system on the generation of interference between two causal orders. We present the environmental instabilities for the switch of two arbitrary quantum operations and examine the influence of environmental temperature on each potential outcome of control post-selection. Additionally, we explore how environmental instabilities affect protocol performance, including switching between mutually unbiased measurement observables and refrigeration powered by causal order superposition, providing insights into broader implications.},

  abstract={The development of a self-consistent thermodynamic theory of quantum systems is of fundamental importance for modern physics. Still, despite its essential role in quantum science and technology, there is no unifying formalism for characterizing the thermodynamics within general autonomous quantum systems, and many fundamental open questions remain unanswered. Along these lines, most current efforts and approaches restrict the analysis to particular scenarios of approximative descriptions and semi-classical regimes. Here, we propose a novel approach to describe the thermodynamics of arbitrary bipartite autonomous quantum systems based on the well-known Schmidt decomposition. This formalism provides a simple, exact, and symmetrical framework for expressing the energetics between interacting systems, including scenarios beyond the standard description regimes, such as strong coupling. We show that this procedure allows straightforward identification of local effective operators suitable for characterizing the physical local internal energies. We also demonstrate that these quantities naturally satisfy the usual thermodynamic notion of energy additivity.},
